# SSH Removal and Default Confirmation Update

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### üîí **SSH Support Completely Removed**

#### Files Updated:
1. **`cmd/git-clone/main.go`**
   - Removed SSH/HTTPS selection prompt
   - Removed `useSSH` parameter from function calls
   - Simplified cloning workflow

2. **`internal/cloner/manager.go`**
   - Updated `CloneRepositories()` function signature (removed `useSSH` parameter)
   - Updated `CloneRepositoriesWithRetry()` function signature (removed `useSSH` parameter)
   - Removed SSH logic from job creation

3. **`internal/cloner/worker.go`**
   - Removed `UseSSH` field from `CloneJob` struct
   - Simplified `processJob()` to only use HTTPS cloning
   - Removed SSH branching logic

4. **`internal/cloner/git.go`**
   - **Completely removed** `CloneWithSSH()` function
   - Only HTTPS cloning via `CloneRepository()` function remains

### üìù **Confirmation Default Changed to "N"**

#### Updated Files:
1. **`internal/ui/prompt.go`**
   - Enhanced `PromptConfirmation()` function documentation
   - Confirmed default behavior: only returns `true` for explicit "y" or "yes"
   - Empty response or any other input defaults to `false` (No)

2. **`internal/ui/bubbletea_selector.go`**
   - Confirmation dialog already shows "(y/N)" format
   - Default behavior matches requirement (pressing Enter defaults to No)

### üìö **Documentation Updates**

#### Updated Files:
1. **`README.md`**
   - Removed SSH/HTTPS selection from feature list
   - Updated "First Run Experience" to remove SSH choice step
   - Changed "SSH/HTTPS Support" to "HTTPS Cloning" 
   - Emphasized secure HTTPS-based cloning

2. **`demo.sh`**
   - Added mention of "Secure HTTPS cloning"
   - Updated confirmation dialog description to include "default: No"

3. **`BUBBLETEA_UPGRADE.md`**
   - Updated user experience section to mention secure HTTPS cloning
   - Added note about confirmation dialogs defaulting to "No"

## üéØ **Result**

### Before:
```bash
Selected 3 repositories for cloning
Use SSH for cloning? (requires SSH key setup) (y/N): 
Using HTTPS for cloning
Starting repository cloning...
```

### After:
```bash
Selected 3 repositories for cloning
Starting repository cloning...
```

### Confirmation Behavior:
- **Enter key**: Defaults to "No" (safe default)
- **"y" or "yes"**: Explicitly confirms "Yes"
- **Any other input**: Defaults to "No"

## üîí **Security & Simplicity**

### Benefits:
1. **Simplified UX**: One less decision for users to make
2. **Secure by Default**: HTTPS is more universally accessible
3. **No SSH Setup Required**: Works immediately without SSH key configuration
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Less code to maintain and fewer potential failure points
5. **Safe Defaults**: Confirmation dialogs require explicit "yes" to proceed

### Technical Improvements:
- **Removed ~25 lines** of SSH-related code
- **Eliminated** `UseSSH` parameter passing through function chains
- **Simplified** job processing logic
- **Reduced** potential error scenarios (no SSH key issues)

The application now provides a streamlined, secure experience focused on HTTPS cloning with safe default behaviors! üöÄ
